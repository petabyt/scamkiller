Hello, I could not find an abuse/fraud reporting email to send this to. 
I am contacting your team as a result of the .ROBOSECURITY cookie hacking issues. 
As many, many, accounts have been taken down, and the more recent and 
successful Trump propaganda cookie loggers have stolen even more accounts, 
I believe steps should be taken to combat this, as reporting every single
 Youtube video and service does not work. 

I have been investigating this whole type of fraud for a few days, and have been trying to investigate
and break as many as I possibly could.

I don't know how your backend works exactly, but if something can be done,
at least a warning message to all users, that would help a lot.

Security is not my strong point, as I am a software developer, but if any
steps could be taken to combat this mass issue, that would make taking
down the entire operation a lot easier.

Thanks, Dan
